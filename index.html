      <p>Hello! My name is Jonathan Truong, but most people call me "Jon". Currently I reside and
       work in San Ramon. I work full time as an assistant site director at an afterschool
      enrichment program.
      Some things that I like to do when I'm not working would be to go and try new restaurants or "foodie spots".
      I'm always open to try new kinds of food and whenever I do, I'll share my experience on my Instagram.
      Since I like to eat, the way I burn those calories is by going to the gym. I love being active and working out.</p>
